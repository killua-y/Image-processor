To use our program please read the instructions that are printed at the top of
the GUI when the program is first booted up. You will first have to load an image
using the load image button down below where it will prompt you to load an image 
from your files. You can also save an image using the save image beneath the load image
button which will save the image you are currently working on, and you can choose what to
name the file to save as.

The next buttons are the "brighten" and "darken" buttons which when you click them, you will be
prompted to type in an increment value for how much to brighten or darken by. For brighten,
type a positive number to increment by. For darken, type a negative number denoted by -100
for example to darken by.

The rest of the commands are within the Modifications button at the bottom which you simply
need to press the modification button and then the command that you want to take effect on
the current image. These commands include the following:
Horizontal-FLip, Vertical-Flip, Red Component Visualization, Green Component Visualization,
Blue Component Visualization, Value Component Visualization, Intensity Component Visualization,
Luma Component Visualization, Greyscale, Sepia, Blur, and Sharpen.
